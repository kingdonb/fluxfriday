# Four Fabulous Flux Fables

  * Jenkins + Flux
  * What is GitOps?
  * GitOps Hands-On Overview
  * GitOps Best Practices

# Jenkins

  * We love using Jenkins
  * {::wait/}Invested
  * {::wait/}Ecosystem
  * {::wait/}Use Jenkins for Everything

# Jenkins

  * Pipelines
  * {::wait/}Workflows
  * {::wait/}Hogwash

# Jenkins + Flux (1/3)

  * Jenkins-CI
  * Flux-CD
  * {::wait/}CI - Build OCI Images
  * {::wait/}CD - Deploy OCI Images

# Jenkins + Flux (2/3)

  * There is no intersection
  * {::wait/}Use one tool for one job
  * {::wait/}Other tool use for other

# Jenkins + Flux (3/3)

  * Thanks for coming to my TED Talk

# Jenkins + Flux (4/...)

  * Not the whole story
  * There is some new information we can share

# Jenkins + Flux

  * What is GitOps?
  * {::wait/}(according to Flux?)

# Jenkins + Flux

  * Declarative
  * Pull-based
    * (or Push-based){::wait/}
  * {::wait/}Revision Control (Git)
  * {::wait/}Automation reconciles (closed loop)

# Jenkins + Flux

  * What is GitOps?
  * Declarative, Pull-based
  * {::wait/}Image Automation - Write to Git
  * {::wait/}Git - Single Source of Truth

# Flux

  * Image Update Automation
  * {::wait/}Select Latest Image By (...)
  * {::wait/}Sortable Image Tags
  * {::wait/}{branch}-{sha}-{ts}

# Flux v2

  * image-reflector-controller
  * {::wait/}image-automation-controller

# Flux v2

  * ImagePolicy
  * {::wait/}SemVer
  * {::wait/}Alphabetical (CalVer)
  * {::wait/}Numerical

# Flux (v2)

  * Tagging/Version

# Jenkins

  * How to actually build container images
  * In 2016-2020: Use Privileged Pod, mount /var/run/docker.sock
  * {::wait/}Assume Kubernetes host runs Docker
  * {::wait/}(no -- bad!)

# Jenkins (in 2021 and beyond)

  * buildkitd, cli for kubernetes
  * {::wait/} (rootless containers!)
  * {::wait/}unprivileged userns
  * {::wait/}Most vulnerable kernel code (?)

# CI-Cluster
